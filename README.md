# Example Voting App - Development Environment

This document outlines the deployment options for Example Voting App in terms of infrastructure for development environment.


# Deployment Options:

Local Docker Compose:

Pros: Docker Compose lets us set up development environment locally on the developer's machine without the need for complex infrastructure setup. It also allows us to deploy several services at the same time and provides possibility to run end-to-end tests and provide more security and control over the infra.

Cons: This setup is often good for individual or small team as the local development environment may not accurately reflect the production environment's infrastructure, network configuration, and scaling etc. This can lead to unexpected issues during the deployment phase.

Remote Environment: 

Pros: Vms are another option which can be provisioned on cloud as well as on-prem. It provides flexibility and isolation. Helpful in case of varying hardware capabilities or when in need to test the application on different operating systems. Remote environment provide isolated setup that closely mimic the production which increase reliability, provides much faster response, facilitate automation and environment can de configured to meet necessary security and compliance. Production-like development environments not only increase reliability by avoiding configuration drift and early access to end-to-end tests, they also increase overall team productivity and satisfaction.

Cons: Using VMs also has it disadvantages like using K8s cluter on VMs result in overhead and resource utilization. Environment require time and effort to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot the development environment. 

Hybrid Approach:

Pros: By using a local containerized setup for day-to-day development, and a cloud-based environment for specific tasks. with this approach we can leverage the benefits of both cloud and local to create a tailored development environment that fits the project needs. we can use cloud for specific tasks which require higher resource and hardware capabilities without having to setting up the whole infra locally. We can reduce cost by using local resources for lighter tasks.

Cons: Hybrid approach might be complex to manage due to the integration of local and cloud environments and the differences might sometimes lead to inconsistencies.


The choice ultimately depends on the team size, project requirements, cost management and resemblence to the prod environment etc. For a development environment, local deployment is generally best for initial development due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of use. However, cloud VMs are ideal for testing in a more realistic production-like environment, especially for load testing and Isolation. Hybrid approach can provide a balanced solution, by using utilizing both local and cloud resources to ensure compatibility and performance under conditions similar to production.

## Factors to consider when choosing the appropriate infrastructure: 
    •     Team size and expertise 
    •     Alignment with Production Environment
    •     Code dependencies
    •     Cost and Resource Efficiency
    •     Resource Availability
